#define variables 
theta-m == (actual integer value)

x = rf2desired - rf2
xc1 = (set integer value)
xc2 = (set integer value, close to zero most likely)
x2 = xc2 - rf2
D = 5.625
D1 = rf2( 1 - pow((( rf1 - rf2 ) / D ), 2) )
theta-c = acos( D1 / rf2 ) 


void loop() {

  //idk how to read from the sensors? but that would happen here rf1 and rf2
  if rf2 == xc2
    stop
  else
    motorRun(150, 150); 
//need to loop this or run this until its equal? or will that happen on its own?
else { 
if (theta-c > theta-m); {
  motorRun(200, -200); //does there need to be a time constraint or something here?
}
else {
  motorRun(-200, 200);
}
}

I need help <3
